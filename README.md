This is a game project that uses hand gesture recognition to interact with the characters. The game allows the user to perform four actions with their hands: move the cursor, grab a character, strangle a character (which makes the character’s head explode), and create characters. The game uses a webcam to capture the user’s hand movements and a machine learning model to recognize the gestures.
